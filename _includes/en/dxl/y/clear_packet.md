## [Multi-Turn Clear Packet](#multi-turn-clear-packet)

DYNAMIXEL-Y is capable of backing up Multi-Turn information, ensuring that it is preserved even after a power outage. A Multi-Turn Clear Packet is required to reset this value. After Multi-Turn Clear, DYNAMIXEL will undergo a reboot.  
After replacing the Multi-Turn backup battery, it is essential to perform this process to ensure normal operation.


**Note**: Multi-Turn Clear resets the absolute position value to within one motor revolution. Models with an attached reducer may lose their reducer-based absolute position. Please set the absolute position of the reducer to 0 and proceed with Multi-Turn Clear.
