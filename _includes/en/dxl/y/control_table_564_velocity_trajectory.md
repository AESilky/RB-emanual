This is the target velocity trajectory profile generated by the profile. Depending on the control mode, the operational method varies as follows. Please refer to the [Profile Velocity(244)] for further details. 

1. Velocity control mode : When the profile ends, Velocity Trajectory(564) becomes the same as [Goal Velocity(528)].
2. Position control mode : Target velocity trajectory to create [Position Trajectory(560)]. When the profile ends, Velocity Trajectory(564) becomes ‘0’.
