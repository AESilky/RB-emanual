The open_manipulator_controller package created by ROBOTIS helps to control each joint of OpenMANIPULATOR-X and to check the status of OpenMANIPULATOR-X through ROS [messages](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_controller_package/#message-list).  
In order to operate the OpenMANIPULATOR-X, the controller package should be running in the first place.

Other experimental controllers are available in the [Experimental](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_controller_experiment/) section.
