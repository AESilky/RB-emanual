> RC-300

This device allows you to control robots via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.

{% capture rc-300_01 %}
**NOTE**:
- When RC-300 is powered on, a blue LED will illuminate.
- If RC-300 is not connected to a BLE slave device, the blue LED will blink; once connected, it will remain continuously lit.

# [How to Use](#how-to-use)

1. Power On
    - The central POWER button serves as the power button. Press it lightly for about 1 second, and the blue LED will turn on, indicating that the power is on.
2. LED (Power and BLE Connection Status)
    - If not connected to a BLE slave device, the blue LED will blink.
    - Once connected to a BLE slave device, the blue LED will stay on without blinking.
3. Power Off
    - Press and hold the central POWER button for approximately 2 seconds. The blue LED will blink rapidly four times before turning off.
4. Auto Power Saving Mode
    - If RC-300 is not used for 3 minutes (no button presses), it will automatically turn off to conserve battery power.
    - If the battery voltage is low and needs replacement, the LED will blink rapidly four times, indicating power-saving mode.
5. Transmitting Button Press States
    - While RC-300 is turned on, it transmits packets corresponding to the pressed U/D/L/R/1/2/3/4/5/6 buttons to the paired BLE SLAVE device.
    - It also sends a packet indicating that no buttons are pressed when all buttons are released.
    - For packet details, refer to the [Code Map](#code-map).

# [How to Connect](#how-to-connect)
## Available Wireless Modules and Controllers (1:1 Pairing)

|Module|RC-300|
|:---:|:---:|
|RB-100|O|
|RB-86 / RB-88|O|
|CM-151|O|
|BT-410 Slave Module|O|
|BT-410 Master Module|X|
|BT-210 Slave / Master Module|X|
|BT-100/110A|X|
|ZIG-100/110A|X|

## Connection Procedure
- Confirm that the RC-300's blue LED is blinking.
- Check if the LED on the BLE slave device you want to connect to is blinking.
- Move the RC-300 close to the BLE slave device you want to pair with.
- Once pairing is successful, both devices will have steady, non-blinking LEDs.
- Proximity pairing like this is required only during the initial pairing; subsequent pairings will occur automatically when both devices are within range (approximately 10 meters).

# <a name="code-map"></a>[Code Map](#code-map)

When buttons on the RC-300 remote control are pressed, corresponding code values are transmitted as shown in the code map below.

When more than 2 buttons are pressed, the sum of pressed code values will be sent.  
- `Example` Button U + Button 3 => Code value of Button U (1) + Code value of Button 3 (64) = Sending Value (65)
- `Example` Button 1 + Button 5 => Code value of Button 1 (16) + Code value of Button 5 (256) = Sending Value (272)

**NOTE** : There are 128 combination keys usable in IR Mode.There are 512 combinations keys usable in Zigbee Mode.

# [Communication Packet](#communication-packet)

RC-300 uses communication packets in the following format, similar to RC-100 series remote controllers.

![](/assets/images/parts/communication/rc-100_13.gif)

- `~` represents Inverse (1â€™s Complement)  
  - `Example` ~0xAA -> 0x55, ~0xF0 -> 0x0F
  - `Example` `DATA` : 0x1234 -> `Packet` : 0xFF 0x55 0x34 0xCB 0x12 0xED
