> RB-88 Controller

# [Introduction](#introduction)

- The RB-88 is a controller used in the OLLO Spark and OLLO Excel Kit, featuring Bluetooth functionality and built-in devices such as motor output shafts and various input/output devices (infrared sensor, microphone, LED, buzzer).
- The RB-88 controller is compatible with ROBOTIS' 12mm standard products.
- Firmware updates and recovery can be done via the STEAMCUP app.
- You can program the RB-88 with [R-Block] and download the program to make the controller operate.

- **Power Button**: Short press to turn on. The power LED lights up, and the controller enters Play Mode and downloaded program on the controller starts running. If held for more than 3 seconds, the buzzer beeps twice, indicating Manage Mode. Holding for about 9 seconds results in three beeps, indicating Firmware Recovery Mode.
- **Power LED**: Pressing the power button causes the blue LED to flash. When connected to the BT-430 dongle, the blue LED remains on without flashing.
- **LED 1,2 (LED)**: LEDs can be turned on or off through programming.
- **IR Sensor (1~6)** (Infrared Sensor): Six infrared sensors are equipped, allowing programming using sensor values from different directions.
- **3Pin DXL Port (1,2) (3-pin port)**: Located below the power button, can be used to connect [XL330-M077-T](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl330-m077/) and [XL330-M288-T](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl330-m288/), and more.
- **Center Motor Shaft**: You can attach a cross axle. The gear ratio is 30:1.
- **Rear Motor Shaft**: You can attach a cross axle. The gear ratio is 60:1.

# [Power Supply](#power-supply)

The RB-88 is powered by three AA batteries.

# [Controller Modes](#controller-modes)

## [Play Mode](#play-mode)

- With the controller off, briefly press the power button to start, and the blue LED lights up, indicating the controller is in Play mode.
- Play mode executes R-Block programs downloaded to the controller.
- The number of times you press the start button in succession at the initial start increases the button press count. You can use this parameter for programming to make RB-88 perform different actions depending on the number of times you press the start button.
- In Play mode, if Bluetooth is not paired with a Master device, the blue LED flashes. When paired, the blue LED remains on without flashing.

## [Manage Mode](#manage-mode)

- With the controller off, press and hold the power button for about 1 second until you hear two short beeps, and the blue LED lights up, indicating the controller is in Manage mode.
- In Manage mode, you can download R-Blcok programs.
- In Manage mode, if Bluetooth is not paired with a Master device, the blue LED flashes. When paired, the blue LED remains on without flashing.

## [Recovery Mode](#recovery-mode)

- With the controller off, press and hold the power button for about 9 seconds until there is no more sound. This indicates entry into Recovery mode.
- In Recovery mode, both the orange and blue LEDs will flash.
- Connect the RB-88 controller in Recovery mode by clicking "Add Robot" in the STEAMCUP app. ([Connect from Mobile](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/controller/rb-88/#connection-from-mobile))
- Do not close the app during the update.

# [Straightness Calibration](#straightness-calibration)

- When running from the above block in R-Block, RB-88 automatically corrects straightness during forward motion.

    ![rb_88_foward](/assets/images/parts/controller/rb-88/rb_88_foward_en.jpg)

- When running from the above block in R-Block, RB-88 automatically corrects straightness during backward motion.

    ![rb_88_backward](/assets/images/parts/controller/rb-88/rb_88_backward_en.jpg)

- Long-distance travel is required for straightness calibration to be completed.
- The straightness calibration value is retained even when the power is turned off.
