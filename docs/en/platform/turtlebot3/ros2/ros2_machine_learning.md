# [[ROS 2] Machine Learning](#ros-2-machine-learning)

Machine learning, learning through experience, is a data analysis technique that teaches computers to recognize what is natural for people and animals. There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning.

This application is reinforcement learning with DQN (Deep Q-Learning). The reinforcement learning is concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment, so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

This shows reinforcement learning with TurtleBot3 in gazebo.
This reinforcement learning is applied DQN(Deep Q-Learning) algorithm with LDS.  
We are preparing a four-step reinforcement learning tutorial.

2. Install ROS dependency packages for Python 3.6 version.
``` bash
$ pip3 install -U rosinstall msgpack empy defusedxml netifaces
```

### [Tensorflow](#tensorflow)

This instruction describes how to install TensorFlow in terminal.  
1. Open a terminal.
2. Install TensorFlow.
``` bash

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
1. Open a terminal
2. Install Keras.
``` bash
$ pip3 install keras==2.1.5
```

### [Machine Learning packages](#machine-learning-packages)
**WARNING**: Be sure to install [turtlebot3](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3), [turtlebot3_msgs](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs) and [turtlebot3_simulations](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations) package before installation of machine learning packages.
{: .notice--warning}

1. Open a terminal.
2. Install turtlebot3_machine_learning packages. 
``` bash
$ cd ~/robotis_ws/src/
$ git clone -b ros2 https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_machine_learning.git
$ cd ~/robotis_ws && colcon build --symlink-install
```

## [Set Parameters](#set-parameters)
The goal of DQN Agent is to get TurtleBot3 to the goal to avoid obstacles. 
The closer TurtleBot3 gets to, the more positive reward it gets. When TurtleBot3 gets closer to the goal, it gets a positive reward. When it gets farther it gets a negative reward.
The episode ends when the TurtleBot3 crashes on an obstacle or after a certain period of time. During the episode, TurtleBot3 gets a big positive reward when it gets to the goal, and TurtleBot3 gets a big negative reward when it crashes on an obstacle.

### [Set State](#set-state)
State is an observation of environment and describes the current situation. Here, `state_size` is 26 and has 24 LDS values, distance to goal, and angle to goal.

Turtlebot3's LDS default is set to 360. You can modify sample of LDS at `turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description/urdf/turtlebot3_burger.gazebo.xacro`.

``` bash
<xacro:arg name="laser_visual" default="false"/>   # Visualization of LDS. If you want to see LDS, set to `true`
```
``` bash
<scan>
  <horizontal>
    <samples>360</samples>            # The number of sample. Modify it to 24
    <resolution>1</resolution>
    <min_angle>0.0</min_angle>
    <max_angle>6.28319</max_angle>
  </horizontal>
</scan>
```

| ![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/machine_learning/sample_360.png) | ![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/machine_learning/sample_24.png) |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                            **sample = 360**                             |                            **sample = 24**                             |

### [Set Action](#set-action)
Action is what an agent can do in each state. Here, turtlebot3 has always 0.15 m/s of linear velocity. angular velocity is determined by action.

| Action | Angular velocity(rad/s) |
|:------:|:-----------------------:|
|   0    |          -1.5           |
|   1    |          -0.75          |
|   2    |            0            |
|   3    |          0.75           |
|   4    |           1.5           |

### [Set Reward](#set-reward)
When turtlebot3 takes an action in a state, it receives a reward. The reward design is very important for learning. A reward can be positive or negative. When turtlebot3 gets to the goal, it gets big positive reward. When turtlebot3
collides with an obstacle, it gets big negative reward. If you want to apply your reward design, modify `setReward` function at  `/turtlebot3_machine_learning/turtlebot3_dqn/src/turtlebot3_dqn/environment_stage_#.py`.

### [Set Hyper Parameters](#set-hyper-parameters)
This tutorial has been learned using DQN. DQN is a reinforcement learning method that selects a deep neural network by approximating the action-value function(Q-value). Agent has follow hyper parameters at `/turtlebot3_machine_learning/turtlebot3_dqn/nodes/turtlebot3_dqn_stage_#`.
