# [What Software, DYNAMIXEL and Parts are compatible with my own controller?](#what-is-the-difference-between-dynamixel-protocol-10-and-20)
- See [Product Compatibility Guide](/docs/en/parts/controller/controller_compatibility/).

# How to download Task Code to my controller? 
- See [Download Task Code](/docs/en/faq/download_task_code/).

# How the X-series can communicate with dynamixel with protocol 1.0?

Users can select DYNAMIXEL [Protocol 1.0] and [Protocol 2.0] when using X-series.
Even if Protocol 1.0 is selected, Protocol 2.0 Control Table will be used.
It is recommended to use an identical protocol version for multiple DYNAMIXEL's.

**TIP** : MX-series DYNAMIXEL except MX-12W can be upgraded to Control Table 2.0 for the new firmware features, new control table, and "Protocol Version" parameter for Communication Protocol flexibility.

# What is RoboPlus?

RoboPlus (1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0), which is also called R+, is software tool to provide diverse features, such as programming (R+ Task), 3D motion design tool (R+ Motion), and product manager tool for a firmware recovery/update and control table (R+ Manager).

**R+ 1.0**
  - [R+ Task](/docs/en/software/rplus/task/)
  - [R+ Motion](/docs/en/software/rplus/motion/)
  - [R+ Manager](/docs/en/software/rplus/manager/)
  
**R+ 2.0**
  - [R+ Task 2.0](/docs/en/software/rplus2/task/)
  - [R+ Motion 2.0](/docs/en/software/rplus2/motion/)
  - [R+ Manager 2.0](/docs/en/software/rplus2/manager/)
  - [R+ Design 2.0](/docs/en/software/rplus2/design/)
  - [R+ Scratch](/docs/en/software/rplus2/scratch/)

**R+ 3.0**
  - [R+ Task 3.0](/docs/en/software/rplustask3/)
  
{% capture rplus3 %}
**NOTE**: 
- R+ Task 3.0 is software in which R+ Task 2.0 (a programming tool) and R+ Motion 2.0 (3D Motion desgin tool) are integrated.
- See [Product Compatibility Guide](/docs/en/parts/controller/controller_compatibility/), and choose the right software which is compatible with your controller in use.

# What is the meaning of error codes when I use R+ Task 1.0 
- See [Error Messages](/docs/en/software/rplus1/task/task_misc/#error-messages).

# What shall I do if the rule check error shows up while I am writing RoboPlus Task code?
- See [Rule Check](/docs/en/software/rplus1/task/task_misc/#rule-check).

# Why joints on the robot in use get loose while I make the motions.
- See [Auto Shutdown function](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/rplus1/motion/#dynamixel-auto-shutdown-function). 

# How can I develop a firmware for the controller by myself using C Language?
- Embedded C can be used to develop its own programming.
